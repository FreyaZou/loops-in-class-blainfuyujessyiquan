# Loops and Basic Functions Lab



In this project we will consider loops and basic functions. As a group please:

1. Make sure you understand what Yahtzee is and what dice combinations you are looking for. 
2. Work through the steps to simulate the game. 
3. For **PHP 2560 ONLY**, please work through the second part working with the data.
